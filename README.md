[pass](http://www.passwordstore.org) is a very simple password store that keeps passwords inside gpg encrypted files inside a simple directory tree. The pass utility provides a series of commands for manipulating the password store, allowing the user to add, remove, edit, synchronize, generate, and manipulate passwords.


Requirements
------------

The `pwgen` package is used to generate passwords and must be available in the repositories. On Redhat and Centos you can add `epel-release` to `pass_packages` or remove `pwgen` from the list.

Role Variables
--------------

```
pass_version: 1.6.5
pass_gpg_key: AFBA32A6
pass_git_remote: git@github.com:user/repo

    - git
    - make

Example Playbook
